# Description
These datasets are from the BRFSS 2015 survey data that collected diabetes, hypertension, and stroke health status.

This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Tableau, Machine Learning and more to visualize diabetes, hypertension, and stroke survey response data from the BRSS in 2015.


We evaluated patients' risk for stroke based on predisposition to a disease, lifestyle factors such as physical activity, food consumption, and drinking alcohol, and risk depending on age. The dataset chosen evaluates 70,000+ survey responses on Diabetes, Hypertension, and Stroke Prediction with factors such as age, sex, high cholesterol, physical activity, BMI, fruit consumption, smoker status, and more. 


To start, we used MongoDB to store the data, create tables, run SQL queries, use ML to predict the disease risk, and visualize our chosen interests in Python and Tableau.

# Analysis and Summary
The analysis of the various diseases shows that the more risk factors a patient has, the more likely they are to have these diseases and be at an increased risk for stroke. There is a linear relationship between most of the risk factors and the presence of the diseases as well as the increased risk of having those diseases. 

It is important to analyze this data as it provides the evaluated risk to a patient which can allow healthcare providers to determine levels of care or tailor care as needed for their patients. It also helps providers determine the best ways to educate their patients determine the best ways to manage their health, such as by improving their lifestyle factors of the type of food they are eating, dietary supplements, and exercise. 

These types of surveys are also important on a national and global scale to determine the health of the people across the nation and to keep track of trends over time. This in turn can help determine health standards nationally such as improving access to clean and healthy food, making our cities more walkable and sustainable, and improving our statistics over time.
