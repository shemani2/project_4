# Description
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Tableau, Machine Learning and more to visualize diabetes, hypertension, and stroke survey response data from the BRSS in 2015.


We are interested in evaluating a patientâ€™s risk for the disease based on predisposition to a disease, lifestyle factors such as physical activity, food consumption, and drinking alcohol, and risk depending on age. The dataset chosen evaluates 70,000+ survey responses on Diabetes, Hypertension and Stroke Prediction with factors such as age, sex, high cholesterol, physical activity, BMI, fruit consumption, smoker status, and more. 


To start, we plan on using MongoDB to store the data, create tables, run SQL queries, use ML to predict the disease risk, and visualize our chosen interests in Python and/or Tableau.

# Describing the Datasets
This dataset is collected by using an API that encompasses a collection of COVID-19 data from 2021-2023. It is a valuable resource in advancing our understanding of the virus's epidemiology and transmission dynamics. 

# Analysis
New Cases 
- As expected, there are the most new cases in 2021 which followed the incline of cases in 2020 into 2021.
- Remote/ rural counties have smaller populations therefore the numbers may be more or less significant and may inflate the case and hospitalization rates.
- There are outliers for the number of cases in each year which could be due to lifestyle habits, susceptibility to the virus, location, or any number of things. 

Covid Hospitalization Rates
- There is a wide range of bed usage percentages for COVID-19 in all three years, with 2021 having the highest percentage rates in all the counties of Texas.
- The rates reduce thereafter for 2022 and significantly for 2023, which is not unexpected.
- What is unexpected is the rates for each year compared to the various counties, do not hold a significant trend for hospital bed usage. 

Vaccinations
- Between 2021 through the end of 2022, there is a significant increase in vaccination dissemination and administration, with all numbers being well over 100k vaccines administered.
- That trend is the same for all counties across Texas. A significant drop in vaccine administration in 2023 coincides with the drop in new cases and hospitalizations in 2023.
- There is a correlation between vaccinations and the drop in COVID from 2021 to 2023. 


# Summary
- The analysis reveals an inverse relationship between increased vaccinations and the decline of cases and beds being occupied due to the virus. These categories combined demonstrate that things like herd immunity are valuable in the decline of COVID-19. Working together as a community to collect the appropriate data, keep an eye on hospitalization admissions concerning the virus, and how vaccines benefit in reducing the likelihood of getting the virus, collects the data to determine future and long-term impact as well as keep good historical knowledge of how our society fights biological diseases. 

- Some caveats or gaps to be aware of in the data include how there is no significant 2020 data available in this dataset, even with it being sourced from the CDC, which demonstrates that collection of the data was not as paramount at the peak until the virus was controllable. There were no specific methods of collecting or managing the collection of the type of data for evaluation. The means to collect the data and collecting the appropriate data was more significant in 2021 and after which has now become historical data. The other gap to be aware of includes small counties that did not have the resources to add more patients to their care, therefore outsourcing to other healthcare facilities in other counties, which may inflate or deflate the data we have analyzed.
